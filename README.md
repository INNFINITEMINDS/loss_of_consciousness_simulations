# Neural Simulations of Loss of Consciousness

Experimenting with Spiking Neural networks in Brian2

## Experiment 1
Create a Watts-Strogatz network and vary the rewiring probability while measuring the Small World Index.

## Experiment 2
Testing synaptic setups.

Basic synapse on_pre action 'v += weight'.

## Experiment 5
8 modules of excitatory neurons (100 neurons each) and 1000 random connections per module.
One module of inhibitory neurons.

As per experimental setup in Dynamical Complexity slides.
