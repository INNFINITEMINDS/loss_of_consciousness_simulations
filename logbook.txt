We need to lay down the objectives of the experiments

Objectives:
- Build a Watts-Strogatz network - Done
- Simulate the results in the notes of Watts-Strogatz networks with varying p - In progress
- Measure SWI - Done
- Simulate experiment of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the brain.
- Build a model using the connectome, find appropriate weights

Measuring dynamics:
- Measure delta power graph i.e. spectral power vs frequency
- SWI
- Modularity of the network

Questions:
  - How do I compute the spectral density function of a network of neurons?
